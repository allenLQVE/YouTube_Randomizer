YouTube has a terrible shuffle function for their playlist. Therefore, I wrote a player that allows users to search, merge, and play their playlists. The user needs to log in with their Google account to gain access to the application. After user login, their playlists in their account will be loaded automatically. Users can also search or merge the playlist by using the search bar.

This application is built using JavaScript only. It utilizes Google Ouath2 for users to log in to their Google account, and uses Google YouTube API to get playlists from the user's account. After the user fetches the videos in a playlist, the videos will be played using the YouTube iFrame API.

### Privacy Policy
No personal data shared with me will be given to any third party, under any circumstances. Your data will not be saved and also never be used by me for any purpose without specific permission.
The app engages in no ad targeting, data mining, or other activities that may compromise your privacy, and I do not affiliate ourselves with any third parties that do so.
